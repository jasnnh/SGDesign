Sacred Guardians Mobile game site

This is a very old project that i started in High school, the idea was simple code a mobile game with timed action buttons for attack combos and add more elements to the game
over the years this game has evolved from a lot of stages. The game first started off being coded as homebrew straight off of Lua on a PSP handheld device and it had limitations
the PSP RAM was not enough for a big Multiplayer project. Eventually the project moved over to Love2D a windows Lua engine that could handle a bigger task. Love2D down the road
had been ported to Mobile by members of it's community and this is what i currently have left of the project as my Harddrive eventually died leaving no files besides the site and
preview video of the project.

This project was mainly coded in Lua, the server was coded in VB6 (Visual Basic 6) using Winsocket for the server and Luasocket for the client.

Take a look at Design.png file to see how the page looks like.
